# sc-id-converter 
This is a script for Support Engineers to convert the different ID types in SafetyCulture

To use, copy the code to a text editor or click the Open in Collab button. 

In Google Collab, click the play button on the top right side of the code block. Once it successfully loads, it will start asking for IDs. Paste the IDs in the box and press enter. When converting multiple IDs at once, use commas to separate them. Type exit to stop running the code.
